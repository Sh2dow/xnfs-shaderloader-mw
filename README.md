# NFS Most Wanted Shader Compiler & Loader

This is a simple hook for the shader loader in NFS Most Wanted.



You can simply put barebones .fx extension HLSL shaders (specifically HLSL effects) in the fx folder with an appropriate shader name (which you can find in the exe, those fx\\*.efx filenames)



Or alternatively, you may place the equivalent precompiled shader in the game root directory and give it the same name as the internal resource.



If you have a console attached to the game process, you can also monitor any compilation errors that may happen.
